```

## Endpoints

- `status_url` (webhook) — `index.php?route=extension/payment/aneepay/callback`
- `success_url` — `index.php?route=extension/payment/aneepay/success`
- `fail_url` — `index.php?route=extension/payment/aneepay/fail`
- polling — `index.php?route=extension/payment/aneepay/cron` (schedule it in cron)

## Notes

- Setup: Extensions → Payments → AneePay → Edit. Enter the Account ID + Webhook
  Secret (UUID + HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, fail-closed). Optionally
  toggle Test mode (Amoy/USDC).
- Amount semantics: token amount = store_total converted via Frankfurter/ECB
  (auto) + store rate fallback + manual rate; rounded **up** (ceil) in the
  merchant's favour.
- Order metadata is stored in the `aneepay_order` table; the webhook resolves the
  order by `payment_id` / `operation_id` (128-bit int, kept exact) or `Order #N`.
- Cron is not built into OpenCart: add the cron URL above to your server crontab.
